<h3 class="header" > "History of Volleyball" </h3>
<p><span style= "font-family:calibri">Volleyball</span> is a sport that used to be called mintonette. Volleyball originated in the United States in 1895 as a blend of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball.

</p>
<p>
In 1895, William G. Morgan, an instructor at the Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Mass., decided to blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to create a game for his classes of businessmen which would demand less physical contact than basketball. He created the game of Volleyball(at that time called mintonette)

<p>
<br> <em><small>Volleyball is played by both males and females of all ages!</small></em>

<h1 class="subheader">"The Net"</h1>
<p>
The net, originally a standard tennis net, stood at 6'6'' and an unlimited number of players could be on each side of the court at any given time. Similar to baseball, a match was made up of nine innings, with each team serving three times in an inning with unlimited contacts. Indoor volleyball was added to the Olympics in 1964.
</p>
<h1 class="subheader">"Players"</h1>
<u>Volleyball is played with 6 players on each team on their respective sides, for a total of 12 players in a game. However Beach Volleyball is played with two players on each side with a total of four players in the game.</u>
